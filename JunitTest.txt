For writing Junit test without bounded with concrete db, we can use mocking frameworks like 'Mockito' which can be used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality like databse connections can be added to the application. Mockito facilitates creating mock objects seamlessly and mocking certain behavior in an application. It helps to test the functionality of a class in isolation.
